# FastPricing
This project aims to investigate the performance of machine learning methods for pricing financial derivatives. 
Given the competitiveness of a market-making environment, the ability to speedily quote option prices consistent with an ever-changing market environment is essential. Thus, the smallest acceleration or improvement over traditional pricing methods is crucial to avoid arbitrage One can arrive at pricing speed-ups of several orders of magnitude by deploying machine learning techniques based on Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). However, this speed-up is obtained with a certain loss of accuracy. 
The essential focus of this project is the study of the speed-up accuracy trade-off for pricing vanilla European options under different models such as Gaussian Process Regression, Random Forest, and Deep Neural Networks (Task A). Additionally, the project studies how incorporating information about options Greeks could lead to improvements in the pricing accuracy for the GPR model (Task B).
